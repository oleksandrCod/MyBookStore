# Book-store api

It is a server web interface, build with Java, Spring Boot, Docker, MySql.
The project follows REST principles implemented with HTTP methods and include all CRUD operations,
such as **CREATE**, **READ**, **UPDATE** and **DELETE**.
There are also implemented authentication with JWT bearer token.
And authorization is realized with RBAC (Role Based Access Control).
This application allows you to look for different books in the store. You can get specific book and look information
about.
Also, you have a shopping cart where you can collect books would you like to buy. You can add books with different
quantity
remove it from shopping cart and change quantity. After you can create order with your items from shopping cart.
As an admin, you can create, delete and update books same with categories. Also, you may change order status.
My application is typical solution of simple marketplace.
